In a hidden corner of the abandoned buildings in the Yellow Zone.
Story_85
The female journalist stood in the central clearing with two temporary government agents.
Story_85
The man and woman exuded a suffocating air of authority, their expressions cold and stern.
Story_86
Aeris, Lyra, and Felicia hid in the shadows, waiting for the journalist's signal.
Story_86
This journalist had been publishing stories that praised the trio for pushing back the demonic forces.
Story_86
But the unintended result was making the government look powerless in comparison.
Story_86
The scales of power were tipping in favor of the Battle Maiden Association.
Purple
"The government keeps demanding 'balance,' so the news I bring today should satisfy you, right?"
Story_87
The journalist, dressed in her office uniform, pulled a thick stack of documents from her bag.
Gray
"You better know what you're doing, journalist. Government budget allocation isn’t something your 'sensationalist reports' can influence."
Story_87
The male agent folded his arms, his icy gaze locking onto the journalist.
Purple
"Budget? Right, thanks to my reports, the public believes the Battle Maiden Association is the one keeping the city safe. And the government?"
Purple
"Helpless? Hiding behind desks, signing meaningless orders while the demons have their way?"
Story_87
The male agent took a step forward, his lips curling into a mocking smile as his sharp eyes narrowed.
Gray
"So what do you want? Spit it out. Your reports are driving this city to the brink of collapse. "
Gray
"Do you want the Battle Maiden Association to replace the government?"
Purple
"And you? What have you done besides letting bandits run wild in the Yellow Zone and making shady deals with the demons?"
Story_87
At those words, Felicia raised an eyebrow in the shadows and whispered softly to Aeris.
LightRed
"Did you see that? That woman... something's off about her."
Story_87
Aeris followed Felicia's gaze, noticing the faint, subtle shift in the female agent's expression.
Story_87
The male agent’s voice broke the tension, his tone irritable.
Gray
"Bandits and demons? Baseless accusations won’t hold water with the government."
Story_87
The journalist lifted the documents in her hand, waving them slightly.
Purple
"These are the records—fund flows in the Yellow Zone and the origins of the weapons being traded with the demons. Unfortunately, your government's oversight has too many cracks to ignore."
Story_87
The air grew heavy as the male agent’s face darkened, and he stepped closer to the journalist.
Gray
"What do you want?"
Story_87
At that moment, the female agent suddenly smiled—a sickly sweet smile that carried a chilling undertone.
DarkRed
"She's just testing us, isn’t she? But perhaps we can give her an answer."
Story_87
Felicia’s expression sharpened instantly, and she quickly whispered.
LightRed
"She's a demon! That woman’s a demon!"
Story_87
Aeris and Lyra's faces hardened as realization struck.
LightBlue
"Go. We can't wait any longer!"
Story_88
The three emerged from the shadows simultaneously, breaking the tense stalemate. The male agent immediately reacted, grabbing the journalist and pressing his gun to her temple.
Gray
"Don't move! One step closer, and I'll blow her brains out!"
Story_88
The journalist gasped, eyes wide with panic. The papers in her hand scattered across the ground as she panted in shock.
LightRed
"Let her go!"
Story_88
Lyra and Felicia assumed fighting stances, their gazes locked on the scene.
DarkRed
"You Battle Maidens really are naive. The government wants power, but we... we need time."
Story_89
The moment the words fell, the female agent's figure disappeared. In the blink of an eye, she reappeared behind the male agent.
Gray
"What—?!"
Story_89
Blood splattered. The female agent’s bullet pierced through the male agent’s chest.
Story_89
His body froze momentarily before collapsing to the ground, his face frozen in disbelief and shock.
Story_90
The female agent's eyes turned a deep crimson, small horns emerging on her forehead. In the shadows behind her, faint wings unfurled.
DarkRed
"Calm down. I’m not your enemy. In fact, we share the same goal."
LightBlue
"Same goal? Haven't you demons been invading this city?!"
DarkRed
"Invading? We’ve already lost any hope of victory."
Story_90
She folded her wings, her tone grave yet resolute.
DarkRed
"You Battle Maidens have defended this city, but we... we only want a way out."
DarkRed
"Maris, that arrogant fool, is out of options. She thought she could use human bandits against you, but she’s no longer fit to lead us."
LightBlue
"So you want us to deal with her for you?"
DarkRed
"No, I already have a plan."
Story_90
She smiled faintly, continuing.
DarkRed
"Maris is in the Yellow Zone, trading weapons with the bandit leader at a 'slave market.' Let those overconfident thugs capture her."
DarkRed
"We demons will seize the opportunity to retreat with our spoils, and you—you’ll be hailed as heroes who 'liberated the city.'"
Purple
"This... this is a deal?"
Story_90
The female agent gave a small nod toward the journalist.
DarkRed
"That’s right, journalist. This is the only way. A way for all of us to survive."
DarkRed
"And you—you’ll write a sensational story that ends the tension between the government and the Battle Maiden Association."
