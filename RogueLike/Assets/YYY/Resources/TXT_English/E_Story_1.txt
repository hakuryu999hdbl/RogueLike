Story_02
As darkness from the monstrous invaders engulfed the city, Airisu stood in the ruins, gripping her sword tightly. 
Story_00
Her hands trembled slightly, but she took a deep breath and slowly closed her eyes.
LightBlue
“To defeat the Nightmare… I must confront my deepest fears…”
Story_00
The moment she closed her eyes, the world was swallowed by darkness.
Story_00
A chilling, dreadful sensation stabbed through her, as if countless whispers were eating away at her spirit.
DarkRed
“Give up, Iris. This is who you truly are…” 
Story_00
A cold whisper echoed in the darkness.
Story_23
Airisu turned towards the voice to see a woman with white hair, red eyes, and long, sharp red horns standing before her. 
Story_23
The woman wore a revealing black outfit and high heels, a wicked smile on her face.
LightBlue
“So… you’re the Nightmare?”
Story_23
Airisu’s voice quivered, yet she raised her sword without hesitation.
DarkRed
“Yes, I am the fear hidden deep within you.” 
Story_23
The Nightmare walked closer with an air of mockery, her gaze fixed on Airisu. 
DarkRed
“I’ll show you just how powerless you are.”
LightBlue
“Shut up!”
Story_28
Airisu shouted, charging towards the Nightmare with all her might. 
Story_24
But in that moment, the Nightmare vanished, and countless replicas of Airisu herself appeared around her, forming a circle.
LightBlue
“Where are you?!” 
Story_24
Airisu shouted in frustration, slashing at the replicas one by one.
Story_24
But with each strike, the duplicates turned to mist, leaving her with nothing to hold onto.
DarkRed
“It’s useless, Airisu,” 
Story_24
said a replica that appeared before her, identical in every detail. 
DarkRed
 “I am you… the darkness you cannot deny.”
LightBlue
“I am not you!” 
Story_28
Airisu cried, swinging her sword again, but the replica mirrored her every move, dodging effortlessly.
Story_28
With her strength waning, Airisu dropped to her knees, panting.
Story_24
As her vision blurred, the Nightmare slowly approached her. 
DarkRed
“Give in, Airisu. Accept me, and you’ll escape this fear.”
Story_24
The Nightmare placed her cold fingers on Airisu’s forehead, and though Airisu struggled, her arms felt too heavy to lift.
Story_25
Airisu’s eyes flew open, and she saw Ferishia looking at her with a gentle gaze.
LightRed
“Airisu, are you alright?” 
Story_25
Ferishia’s voice was soft, her hands tenderly holding Airisu’s.
LightBlue
“Ferishia…?”
Story_25
Airisu managed a faint smile, feeling momentarily relieved, but an uneasy feeling washed over her. 
LightBlue
 “Where… where am I?”
LightRed
“It’s over. The Nightmare is gone,”
Story_25
Ferishia said with a reassuring smile, though there was something unsettling in her eyes.
Story_25
Airisu looked around and realized they were still within the Nightmare’s domain.
LightBlue
“Ferishia… why are you here?” 
Story_25
Airisu asked, suspicion creeping into her voice.Ferishia’s lips curved into an ominous smile. 
LightRed
“I am your Ferishia… don’t you trust me?” 
Story_25
Airisu’s heart sank as she realized this was another trick—the Nightmare had taken Ferishia’s form.
LightBlue
“You’re lying… you’re not Ferishia!”
Story_26
Airisu shouted, raising her sword.
Story_26
Suddenly, a firm voice called out from behind her.
LightRed
“Stay away from Airisu!”
Story_26
Turning around, she saw the real Ferishia and Raira standing there, their faces filled with anger. 
Yellow
“Nightmare, your illusions won’t deceive us anymore!”
DarkRed
“So, you finally see through it…”
Story_23
The Nightmare chuckled coldly, reverting to her true form and standing defiantly before them. 
DarkRed
“This is only the beginning. Don’t think you can escape my nightmare.”
LightRed
“Airisu, are you okay? This time, it’s really us!”
Story_27
Ferishia said, her hand on Airisu’s shoulder, her face filled with concern.
Story_27
Airisu hesitated, but upon confirming her allies’ authenticity, she gripped her sword once more.
LightBlue
“Nightmare, this ends here!” 
Story_27
Airisu, Raira, and Ferishia stood side by side, ready for battle.
Story_27
The Nightmare’s eyes gleamed coldly as she summoned a swarm of shadowy duplicates around them, preparing for an attack.
DarkRed
“This will be your final nightmare!” 
Story_27
Her voice echoed ominously as a fierce battle erupted.
