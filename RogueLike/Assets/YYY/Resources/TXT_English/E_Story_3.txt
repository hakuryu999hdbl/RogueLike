Story_02
In the darkness of the desolate ruins. 
Story_35
The demon clan’s female commander was performing a ritual of resurrection. 
Story_35
Surrounding her, writhing tentacles slowly stitched together her destroyed limbs.
Story_35
Regenerating severed arms and legs.
Story_35
As the tentacles covered her skin, breathing new life into her.
Story_35
She rose once again, a cold smile forming on her lips.
Green
"Well done, my loyal servant."
Story_36
she murmured in a low voice as she turned slowly.
Story_36
Directing her words of praise at the kneeling rebel captain of the battle maidens.
Story_36
Once a valiant warrior, her gaze was now vacant, staring lifelessly at her new master.
Story_36
Just then, footsteps and a low murmur broke the silence, echoing from within the shadows. 
Story_40
The demon commander, Maris, turned to see three battle maidens emerge.
Story_40
Their cold eyes fixed on the scene before them.
LightBlue
"Truly loyal, giving up even your will to the demons."
Story_40
Airisu spat coldly, her grip tightening on her sword.
Story_40
A faint smile crept across Maris’s lips as if she could see through Airisu’s anger in an instant. 
Story_40
Slowly, she raised her hand, her voice filled with calm malice. 
Green
“How convenient.” 
Story_40
She replied, her smile freezing.
Green
“Prove your loyalty, my servant.”
Story_40
With that, she lowered her hand.
Story_40
And Carissa rose at her command, moving with a cold, emotionless gaze as she faced her former comrades.
Story_37
At that moment, Airisu, Ferishia, and Raira assumed their stances, unleashing their powers without hesitation.
Story_37
There was no room for doubt.
Story_37
Their former comrade, now the demon-controlled “Rebel Battle Maiden Captain,”
Story_37
Carissa, stood before them. The three battle maidens launched their attack all at once.
Story_37
Stepping forward, Ferishia summoned a blazing fireball in her hand.
Story_37
With a shout full of rage, she hurled it at Maris.
LightRed
“Take this, Maris!”
Story_37
At the same time, Raira unleashed a crackling flash from her hand, sending a bolt of lightning straight toward Maris.
Yellow
“Your poison won’t work on us!”
Story_37
Maris’s smile deepened as she swiftly sidestepped the fireball and lightning, extending her hand to conjure a glowing purple sphere.
Green
“Savor the taste of my toxic miasma!”
Story_37
She released a poison orb that collided with Ferishia’s fireball and Raira’s lightning mid-air.
Story_37
Creating an explosion that illuminated the surroundings with a vibrant flash.
Story_37
Caught in the blast, the three battle maidens staggered but quickly reestablished their stances. 
Story_37
As the smoke cleared, Carissa had already prepared her counterattack, her cold eyes locked onto her former comrades.
Story_37
Without a word, she drew her gun and fired at Ferishia, the bullets visibly laced with paralyzing energy.
LightBlue
“Incoming!”
Story_37
Airisu shouted, swiftly reacting by drawing her ice blade. 
Story_37
A wave of cold energy formed a shield in her hand, deflecting the bullets with a sharp, icy ring.
Story_38
the Rebel Battle Maiden Captain Carissa moved mechanically, her once-expressive face now cold and emotionless.
Story_38
Following Maris’s orders, she attacked the three with merciless precision.
Story_38
firing her gun repeatedly and seamlessly transitioning into close-range combat with her sword techniques.
Story_38
Her movements were devoid of compassion, a testament to her loss of self.
LightRed
“Carissa, snap out of it!”
Story_38
Ferishia cried out, creating a wall of flames to block the bullets as she braced herself against Carissa’s relentless assault.
Green
“Pointless. She’s my slave now, fully under my control!”
Story_38
Maris laughed triumphantly, gazing down at the battle maidens with a sneer.
Story_38
Airisu, keeping a cool head, assessed the situation and gathered her icy power again.
Story_38
Trying to restrict Carissa’s movements. 
LightBlue
“To save her… we must end her suffering ourselves!” 
Story_39
But as the three focused on Carissa, Maris raised her hand, intricate sigils appearing in the air.
Story_39
Swirling to form a crimson portal that opened slowly before her.
Green
“I have no time to waste here.”
Story_39
She sneered, her words filled with contempt as she looked down at the battle maidens, a chilling smile gracing her lips.
Green
“My loyal servant will erase you. I look forward to our next meeting.”
Story_39
With those final words, Maris stepped toward the portal, disappearing without a backward glance. 
Story_39
The three battle maidens, anger simmering within them, turned to face Carissa, who stood blocking their path.
Story_39
Airisu adjusted her grip on her sword, her voice resolute.
LightBlue
“We’ll free her ourselves. Carissa… we’ll release you from this pain!
