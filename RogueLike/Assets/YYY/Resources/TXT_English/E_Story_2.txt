According to rumors, The Shepherd ruled over controlled creatures within the desolate ranch.
Story_02
The three decided to investigate. 
Story_02
Heavy clouds loomed in the sky, and an eerie silence dominated the area.
Story_02
Ferishia, Airisu, and Raira arrived at the ruins of the "Terrifying Ranch".
Story_29
Where faint sounds of moaning and sticky squelching noises still echoed.
Story_29
The putrid smell was overwhelming, and in the dim light, flesh-winged wasps flew through the air. 
Story_29
Looking around, they saw girls hanging high up in restraints, others tied to poles with their legs forced apart…
Story_29
The flesh-winged wasps crawled over their bodies, and from their violated bodies.
Story_29
A multitude of vile parasites, mixed with bodily fluids, were clustering.
Story_29
As they approached the girls, they noticed their nude, trembling bodies covered in pale green mucus.
Story_29
Giant flesh-winged insects gathered around their hips, and the girls’ faces were drained of life.
Story_29
Her Eyes rolled back, as if already lost.
Yellow
“This… is horrific.”
Story_30
Raira grimaced in disgust.
Story_30
Their bodies looked like decaying corpses.
LightRed
“Who could have done this…”
Story_30
Ferishia trembled with anger and horror.
LightBlue
“These were likely the girls once kept on this ranch, now meeting their tragic fate,”
Story_30
Airisu remarked, analyzing the scene calmly.
LightRed
“They’re beyond saving…”
Story_30
Ferishia muttered, accepting the grim reality. The girls’ conditions were beyond recovery.
Story_30
Even so, they couldn’t just abandon these poor souls.
Story_31
The three steeled themselves and moved forward to free the girls one by one.
Orange
“Ugh… uh…”
Story_31
The girl moaned painfully, struggling in vain against her restraints.
Story_31
Ferishia gently lifted her, carrying her to a corner, and carefully undid the restraints. 
Story_31
Once freed, the girl’s body twitched before collapsing in exhaustion.
Story_31
The team continued to release the others.
LightBlue
“Just a little longer…”
Story_31
Airisu whispered softly, easing their bonds.
Story_31
few minutes later, all the girls were freed, though weak and semi-conscious, their lives were not in immediate danger.
Yellow
“Alright! They’re safe now!”
Story_31
Raira said, with a relieved smile, Ferishia let out a sigh of relief.
Story_00
Suddenly, a low growl echoed from the depths of the ruins.
Story_00
Out of nowhere, a voice called from behind them, revealing grotesque, flesh-winged insects lurking in the shadows.
Story_32
These creatures had large, toothed mouths, long, slimy needles dripping with fluids from their abdomens.
Story_32
And sharp claws glistening at the ends of their limbs.
Story_32
The creatures held the girls captive, restraining their bodies with tentacles.
Story_32
Covering them in an aphrodisiac-like slime that heightened their sensitivity, forcing them to climax against their will.
LightBlue
“Are these creatures…?”
Story_32
Airisu muttered.
LightRed
“If we defeat them, we can save these girls!”
Story_32
Ferishia shouted.
LightRed
“Let’s go!”
Story_33
At Ferishia’s command, the three launched an attack, engaging in fierce combat.
Yellow
“Stay alert!”
Story_33
Raira warned.
Story_33
Dodging the tentacles, the three coordinated their attacks, taking down the monstrous insects.
Story_33
However, the control over the girls was not yet broken.
Yellow
“It’s not over… there must be a master controlling this ranch,”
Story_33
Raira murmured.
Story_34
At that moment, a man with his head wrapped in bandages appeared.
Story_34
Dressed in a pristine white suit, he exuded a chilling, bloodthirsty aura from the seams.
Gray
“What business do you have trespassing here?”
Story_34
 The Shepherd spoke in a low, disdainful tone, looking down at them with a twisted smile. 
Story_34
His eyes held a disturbing rationality and an inhuman coldness. 
Story_34
Beneath his bandages writhed sinister tentacles, marking him as a human who had adapted to demonic powers.
LightBlue
“Do you even know how many battle-maidens you’ve sacrificed?!”
Story_34
Airisu shouted in rage, raising her sword to charge forward.
LightRed
“Release the captive battle-maidens!”
Story_34
Ferishia yelled. 
Story_34
The Shepherd responded with a cruel grin, snapping his fingers.
Story_34
In an instant, three red, flesh-winged wasps shot up into the air, darting toward the group with terrifying speed.
