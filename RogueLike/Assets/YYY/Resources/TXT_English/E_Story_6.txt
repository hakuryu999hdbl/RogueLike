Story_03
A month after the defeat of the Four Demon Generals, peace gradually returned to the human world.
Story_03
The three battle heroines also returned to their ordinary lives, continuing to play the role of ordinary high school students.
Story_50
On the day of the school festival, the campus was filled with laughter, and each class's booths were bustling with activity.
Yellow
"Airis, hurry up! This is super fun!"
Story_50
Raira ran excitedly, waving her arms in the air.
LightBlue
"Don't run so fast, Raira... I can barely keep up!"
Story_50
Airis panted and followed behind her.
Story_51
Meanwhile, Ferishia stood quietly at a nearby booth, buying a drink while watching the lively crowd. 
Story_51
But a faint unease lingered in her heart.
Story_51
She turned around and was surprised to find Airis standing behind her with an uncharacteristically serious expression.
LightBlue
"Ferishia, wait a moment."
Story_51
Airis spoke softly.
LightRed
"What is it?"
LightBlue
"About Maris."
Story_52
Airis paused, lowering her voice.
LightBlue
"I suspect she's still alive."
LightRed
"What?! But we clearly saw her..."
Story_52
Ferishia's eyes widened in shock.
LightBlue
"I know, but recently, traces of her bases and facilities were discovered in the border regions."
LightBlue
"While there's no concrete evidence, I don't think we can afford to be careless."
Story_52
Ferishia bit her lip and replied softly:
LightRed
"Understood. We must investigate this with Raira."
Story_00
A few days later.
Story_00
Ferishia tried to contact Airis and Raira but found that both had suddenly gone missing.
Story_00
Anxiously, she searched the school and eventually sensed something unusual in an empty classroom.
Story_00
She pushed the door open to find flickering lights and an eerie silence enveloping the room.
Story_53
At that moment, a cold voice shattered the stillness.
Green
"What a coincidence, Ferishia."
Story_53
Ferishia turned sharply to see a girl in a school uniform leaning against the door frame.
Story_53
With her flowing green hair and piercing red eyes filled with danger.
Story_53
There was no mistaking her—Maris Tenebral, the Demon Lieutenant!
Story_53
Maris had concealed her demonic features, appearing just like an ordinary high school girl.
LightRed
"Maris!"
Story_53
Ferishia instinctively took a fighting stance but forced herself to remain calm.
Story_53
She realized that any battle here could put innocent people at risk.
Green
"Don't be so hasty. I have no intention of wasting my energy here."
Story_54
Maris smirked and elegantly snapped her fingers.
Story_54
With the snap, a warped dimensional rift appeared beside her, resembling a projection-like portal.
Story_54
Inside the portal was a horrifying scene.
Story_54
Airis and Raira were bound by tentacles, their clothing tattered as they weakly struggled.
LightRed
"Airis! Raira!"
Story_54
Ferishia's eyes widened as she tried to rush forward.
Story_54
only to realize that the portal was merely an image projection she couldn't touch.
Green
"They're safe for now... at least for the moment."
Story_55
Maris said with a cold smile.
Green
"But their safety is only temporary. If you make another reckless move, I can't guarantee they'll see the sunrise tomorrow."
Story_55
Ferishia clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms, flames flickering faintly in her hands.
LightRed
"What do you want?"
Green
"Follow me."
Story_55
Maris said coldly as she turned and walked out the door, her voice carrying an undeniable authority.
Green
"Otherwise, I can't guarantee your precious friends won't receive some... 'special attention.'"
Story_55
Ferishia gritted her teeth, glancing back at the portal and then at the direction Maris had disappeared.
Story_55
Finally, she relaxed her fists, extinguishing the flames in her palms.
LightRed
"...Fine. I'll go with you."
...
...
...
Story_56
Ferishia, Airis, and Raira were each confined in cylindrical tanks filled with a strange liquid, unconscious.
Story_56
Their bodies floated in the fluid, still clad in their damaged battle suits, resembling defeated trophies.
Story_57
Maris stood gracefully in front of the tanks.
Story_57
her gothic black dress swaying slightly under the lights, a meaningful smile on her lips.
Story_57
She leisurely observed the three inside the tanks as if admiring works of art.
Green
"Such resilient battle heroines."
Story_57
Maris chuckled softly, her tone laced with contempt.
Green
"But in the end, you still fell into my hands."
Story_57
Beside her, Karisa—the traitorous former squad leader and now the Insect Mother—knelt on one knee and spoke softly.
Gold
"Lady Maris, while we successfully captured them, we are unable to strip them of their powers."
Gold
"Because their male bodies cannot serve as hosts for our beasts."
Story_58
Hearing this, Maris's lips curled into a dangerous smile, her red eyes gleaming with madness.
Green
"Unable to strip their powers? Heh..."
Story_58
She slowly raised her head, a wicked curve forming on her lips.
Green
"What if we... forcibly feminize their bodies?"
Story_58
Karisa blinked, momentarily startled by the suggestion, but quickly bowed her head in deference.
Gold
“As you command, Lady Malice. I will make the preparations immediately.”
Story_58
With a wave of Malice’s hand, the surrounding machinery sprang to life.
Story_58
Crimson lights coursed through the devices.
Story_58
Illuminating the room with an ominous glow that seemed to herald the beginning of a dark ritual.
Story_59
The liquid within the containers began to churn violently. 
Story_59
Suddenly, countless tendrils emerged from the bottom of each chamber.
Story_59
Snaking toward the unconscious bodies of the three captives.
LightRed
“AAAAHHHHH!!”
Story_59
Screams echoed from within the chambers as the tendrils wrapped tightly around Ferishia, Iris, and Lyra.
Story_59
Restraining their limbs and leaving them utterly helpless.
Story_59
The tendrils slithered through the torn gaps in their battle suits, infiltrating and dominating their bodies.

Story_60
The city was alive with neon lights and bustling streets, seemingly at peace. 
Story_60
But lurking in the shadows was an unseen menace, ready to strike.
Story_60
Atop a towering skyscraper, three young women stood silhouetted against the night sky.
LightRed
“How beautiful,” 
Story_60
Ferishia said with a dark smile, her black-and-red corrupted battle suit clinging to her form as flames danced in her hands.
LightRed
“This disgusting city of humans... It would look so much better in ashes.”
Story_61
With a flick of her wrist, a blazing fireball shot down toward the streets below.
Story_61
The flames illuminated her emerald green eyes, now devoid of compassion and filled with destructive glee.
Yellow
“Ferishia, tone it down a bit, will you?”
Story_62
Next to her stood Lyra, sparks of electricity crackling in her hands. Though her tone was playful, the lightning bolts she unleashed were anything but, tearing through the city’s power grid and plunging the area into darkness.
Yellow
“Still, you’re not wrong. Breaking everything feels so... liberating.”
Story_62
She laughed as she spread her arms, sending more electricity cascading down the skyscraper.
LightBlue
“Enough, both of you.”
Story_63
Behind them, Iris spoke in a cold voice. 
Story_63
Her ice blade gleamed in the dim light as she swung it, freezing a fountain below before shattering it into pieces.
LightBlue
“Our goal is to instill fear, not meaningless destruction.”
Story_64
Ferishia shrugged, clearly unimpressed, but refrained from arguing as she continued to toy with her flames.
LightRed
“Boring.”
Story_64
Lyra sighed, letting the lightning in her hands dissipate.
Story_64
The former saviors of humanity had now become the sharpest blades of the demon realm, turning against the very cities they once fought to protect.
