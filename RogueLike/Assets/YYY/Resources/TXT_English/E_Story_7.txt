Following a grueling battle, Ferishia, Airisu, and Raira received an invitation from a well-known journalist.
Story_65
She had been consistently writing reports and praising their heroics, helping to build their reputations as saviors of humanity.
Story_65
Trusting her, the three agreed to meet her at her office.
Story_65
Sitting comfortably in the journalist’s office, a tray of hot tea was placed before them. 
Story_65
Smiling warmly, the journalist said:
Purple
"You’ve worked so hard recently. Please, enjoy this tea. You deserve a break."
Story_65
Unaware of the trap, the three drank the tea.
Story_66
Moments later, their vision blurred, and they fell unconscious.

When Ferishia regained consciousness, she found herself suspended in a dim storage room. 
Story_67
Her hands were tied behind her back, her legs bound tightly with ropes, and her body hung precariously with her high heels barely touching the floor.
Story_67
A gag muffled her voice, reducing her cries to incoherent “mmph” sounds.
Story_67
Her attempts to use her fire abilities failed—her powers were sealed by a glowing collar strapped around her neck.
Story_67
Turning her head with difficulty, she saw Airisu and Raira in the same predicament, hanging helplessly beside her.
Story_68
The door creaked open, and the journalist entered with a calm yet conflicted expression.
Purple
“I’m sorry for doing this to you,” 
Story_68
she said softly.
Purple
“but this is the decision of the Battle Maiden Association’s higher-ups.”
Story_68
Ferishia’s emerald-green eyes widened in shock. 
Story_68
She let out a muffled cry, struggling against her restraints.
Purple
“Do you really think wiping out all the demonic creatures is the ultimate victory? ”
Purple
“If you eliminate the Red Zones entirely, what will become of the Battle Maiden Association? ”
Purple
“How will it survive without an enemy to fight? ”
Purple
“Do you think the government would continue funding us?”
Story_68
Ferishia froze as the horrifying realization dawned on her.
Story_68
She recalled seeing battle maidens among the enemies during recent battles.
Story_68
Could the association have been collaborating with the demons all along?
Purple
“I’ve warned you repeatedly through my messages,”
Story_68
the journalist continued, exasperated. 
Purple
“You pushed the frontlines too fast, leaving the association no choice but to sacrifice you three as scapegoats.”
Story_69
The three were escorted out of the building and onto a police vehicle.
Story_69
As they arrived at the courthouse, an angry crowd greeted them, shouting 
MAN
“Traitors!” 
Story_69
And throwing trash, eggs, and stones at them. Bound and gagged, they could only endure the humiliation.
Story_70
In the courtroom, their shock turned to horror as they saw the presiding judge.
LightRed
“Maris?!”
Story_70
Ferishia screamed through her gag, but the muffled sound barely escaped her lips.
Story_71
The judge, hiding her demonic features, was none other than Maris Tenebral.
Green
“With evidence provided by the Battle Maiden Association.”
Green
“Ferishia, Airisu, and Raira are found guilty of insubordination and the murder of Commander Karisa.”
Story_71
Maris declared with a sinister smile. 
Green
“I hereby strip you of all human rights and sentence you to life imprisonment.”
Story_72
The three maidens struggled violently, their muffled screams echoing through the courtroom. 
Story_72
Police officers struggled to hold them down 
Story_72
Until one of the battle maidens used a whip to strike them into submission.
Story_73
Their "cells" turned out to be three iron cages displayed prominently in the courthouse plaza.
Story_75
Kneeling inside the cramped cages, their hands tied above their heads, they were fully exposed to the enraged crowd.
Story_77
The gathered citizens hurled insults, garbage, and food scraps at them, shouting 
MAN
“Traitors!” “Murderers!”
Story_76
The once-revered heroines were now the targets of public hatred.
Story_76
Raira sobbed uncontrollably.
Story_76
Airisu closed her eyes as if to shut out the world.
Story_76
And Ferishia stared at the crowd, her eyes burning with fury and sorrow.
Story_77
Among the crowd, Maris smirked wickedly, satisfied with the scene.
Green
“You wanted to protect these humans? How ironic. Now, let them destroy you.”
Story_74
At that moment, the three maidens realized that their worst nightmare wasn’t being defeated
Story_74
By demons—it was being betrayed by the very people they had sworn to protect.
