The towering monstrosity, standing 300 meters tall, swayed ominously.

Its countless tendrils writhing and reaching out from the ground.

"Today, we’re going to end it."

Beside her, Airisu looked up at the towering creature with a hint of fear.
Story_42
She held her icy sword, trembling slightly. 
LightBlue
"…I never imagined it would be… this terrifying."
Story_42
She took a deep breath, speaking in a low voice.
LightBlue
"Are we really capable of defeating it… just the three of us?"
Story_43
Trying to shake off her fear, Raira gave a confident smile, summoning a ball of lightning that crackled in her hand.
Story_43
Illuminating her determination.
Story_43
She patted Airisu’s shoulder encouragingly.
Yellow
"Hey, come on, Airisu! There’s no need to be scared. We’re battle maidens, remember?" 
Story_43
Raira’s voice was filled with confidence.
LightRed
"Today, we’re going to shine on this stage!"

"Raira’s right. We’re not just any warriors. We’re humanity’s hope."

Story_43
Airisu tightened her grip on her sword, nodding deeply.
LightBlue
"We have to fight here for the sake of humanity… and see this through to the end."

At that moment, the tower let out a deafening roar, sending countless tendrils bursting from the ground toward them.

Each covered in thorns and suckers, closing in on them. 
Yellow
 "Watch out, Ferishia!"
Story_44
Raira shouted, dodging the tendrils that chased them relentlessly as if they were alive.

"These tendrils… they keep coming back, no matter how many we cut down!"
Story_45
Ferishia gasped, slashing through the tendrils only to see them regenerate instantly.
Story_45
The battle intensified, the stench of decay filling the air around them. 
Story_45
At the base of the tower—a tangled mass of flesh—pulsated with an eerie red glow.
Story_45
As if it were the heart of the monstrous creature.
Yellow
"Ferishia, look! The tower’s root… it’s glowing! Maybe that’s its weak spot!"
Story_45
Raira cried out, her gaze fixed on the tower’s base.
Story_45
Ferishia noticed it too and nodded.
LightRed
"Alright, if we target that root, we might be able to bring down this tower!"
Story_45
The determination in her eyes reflected the weight of the fight for humanity’s future.
Story_45
The three synchronized their movements, dodging the assaulting tendrils as they pushed forward toward the tower’s root.
Story_45
The tendrils lashed out desperately to block them.

But they pressed on, focusing all their strength on attacking the glowing base.
