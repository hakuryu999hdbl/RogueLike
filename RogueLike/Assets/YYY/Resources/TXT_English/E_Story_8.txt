Story_78
The flames of war in the city have finally subsided. The darkness has cleared, and for the first time.
Story_78
the sky returns to its azure blue. Golden sunlight streams through the fractured bridge, warming the earth below.
Story_78
The suffocating red mist in the air has vanished, replaced by a long-lost tranquility.
Story_78
The ruins of the streets are now free of the monstrous beasts, leaving only the three protagonists behind.
Story_78
Airisu, Raira, and Ferishia stand on a broken bridge, gazing into the horizon where the sun slowly sets.
Story_78
Airisu stands on the far left, her blue hair gently tousled by the evening breeze.
Story_78
A hint of calm reflects in her eyes.
LightBlue
“It’s finally... over.”
Story_78
Airisu’s tone carries a trace of exhaustion, but more than that, a sense of relief.
Story_78
Raira stands in the center, holding Ferishia close. Her golden hair gleams brilliantly in the fading sunset light.
Yellow
“We’ve protected this city... and ourselves.”
Story_78
Ferishia, holding onto Raira’s arm, smiles faintly. Her fiery red hair glows with golden edges under the sunlight.
LightRed
“Let’s go see Maris.”
Story_78
She chuckles softly, a rare, relaxed expression gracing her face.
LightRed
“I just received an official invitation from the provisional government. It seems she’s already been captured.”
Story_79
As the heroes who liberated the city,Airisu, Ferishia, and Raira receive an official invitation from the provisional government.
Story_79
They are to visit the underground experimental facility to witness the final fate of their once-greatest enemy—Maris.
Story_79
The war has only just ended, and the area surrounding the base is still bustling with activity.
Story_79
Researchers and government agents move briskly through different sections, while police officers maintain strict order.
Story_79
Armored vehicles roll into the base, carrying the monstrous beasts that failed to escape through the demon realm’s portals.
Story_79
Scientists are on the sidelines taking notes, planning to dissect and research the beasts’ tentacles and flesh.
Story_79
Particularly, they focus on parts exhibiting regenerative properties and the source of demonic toxins.
Yellow
“So this is the post-war research base...”
Story_79
Raira surveys her surroundings with furrowed brows, her gaze full of vigilance.
Story_79
Ferishia gently pats Raira’s shoulder.
LightRed
“Don’t worry. Everything here is under our control now.”
Story_80
Led by armed police officers. 
Story_80
The three are guided through layers of security checks and electronic doors until they reach the core of the underground facility.
Story_80
The air here is cold and sterile, the metal walls glowing with a faint blue light. The hum of machinery echoes throughout the space.
Gray
“Please proceed, you three.”
Story_80
A male and female government agent stand by the entrance, their serious expressions motioning the group forward.
Story_81
At the center of the laboratory, inside a massive water tank, Maris—the once indomitable commander of the demon realm—lies restrained.
Story_81
The great demon who had lived for centuries now resembles a butterfly with its wings ripped away, trapped in the cold center of the laboratory.
Story_81
Her clothing has been entirely stripped, and her exposed body is bound tightly with special material ropes.
Story_81
Her arms are firmly tied behind her back, and the ropes coil around her, emphasizing every curve of her proud figure.
Story_81
Special magical suppressors have sealed away her overwhelming power, leaving her wings and tail hanging limply.
Story_81
Her once-proud legs are spread wide, connected to devices that ceaselessly stimulate her lower body. Data scrolls across the screens nearby.
Story_81
Attempts to resist only activate the devices, forcing her into climax again and again until she collapses in exhaustion.
Story_81
The prideful aura that once defined her as a demon commander has been utterly shattered.
Story_81
Her tentacles and body have become subjects of experimentation, repeatedly tested to uncover the limits and weaknesses of demonic biology.
Story_81
Scientists observe her reactions from behind transparent partitions, noting every detail and discussing how to further exploit her body’s potential.
Story_81
The screens display her biological data in cold, indifferent text, devoid of any sympathy for her suffering.
Green
“Despicable humans! How dare you humiliate the great Maris with such filthy experiments! You lowly worms are unworthy of even touching me!”
Story_83
She snarls through gritted teeth, her crimson eyes brimming with rage and disdain.
LightBlue
“Looks like the pride of the demon realm has long since crumbled.”
Story_83
Airisu sneers from the side, casually flipping through a data log in her hand.
Green
“What did you say?!”
Story_83
Maris struggles, but no matter how hard she pulls, the ropes do not budge.
Gray
“Lady Maris, we will now test your adaptability as a demon mother.”
Story_83
The researcher speaks with a calm smile, completely ignoring Maris’s former status.
Green
“What?!”
Story_83
Maris’s expression freezes before turning to shock and anger.
Green
“How dare you—use me, the great demon, for such vile experiments! You will regret this!”
Story_82
The researcher dismissively presses a button. A flash of light gleams as liquid is injected into Maris’s neck.
Green
“Guh... Ah?!”
Story_82
Maris feels a searing heat spreading through her body, and slowly, her control over her movements slips away.
Story_82
Her limbs begin to tremble, and the fury on her face is gradually replaced by an inescapable shame.
Gray
“Begin A-Type egg injection.”
Story_82
A massive crawling meat worm emerges at Maris’s feet. Driven by its mothering instinct, it reaches for the restrained Maris with its tentacles.
Story_82
The thick tentacles slide slowly into her nipples, pushing thumb-sized eggs into her chest with unrelenting precision.
Story_82
As the eggs are injected, her breasts swell, the rounded bulges becoming clearly visible.
Green
“Uoooh?!... Nnngh!!”
Story_82
Maris’s eyes rolled back from the intense stimulation, feeling her breasts swell further as they were filled with eggs.
Gray
“Injecting B-Type eggs, targets: uterus and rectum.”
Story_82
Larger eggs entered her uterus and rectum through the tentacles, causing her abdomen to rise into a prominent, rounded arc.
Gray
“Activate rapid incubation mode.”
Story_82
Her nipple holes were forcibly stretched wide, as the spiral patterns on the rods rubbed violently against her sensitive inner walls.
Green
“Uoooooooh?!... Nnnnghh?! Ahhhhhh?!!!”
Story_82
Maris’s body convulsed uncontrollably, her consciousness blurring as she failed to endure the overwhelming stimulation.
Story_83
As the tentacles withdrew, a torrent of milky white liquid burst from her nipple holes.
Story_83
Following that, a demon beast egg emerged. Soon, the area around her was littered with eggs expelled from her nipples.
Green
“Uoooooooh?!... Noooooooo!!!!”
Story_83
Maris’s eyes filled with terror and despair as she was forced to watch herself become a breeding ground for the demon beast larvae.
Story_83
The unbearable stimulation forced her into a screaming climax, tears streaming down her cheeks.
Story_83
Her pupils dilated slightly, her expression twisting into frenzied madness.
Story_83
And faint moans escaped her lips as all her former pride and cold demeanor faded.
Story_83
This process repeated itself endlessly, progressing from A-Type to Z-Type eggs, each cycle accompanied by increasingly brutal violations.
Story_83
Her body grew steadily weaker. Her breasts became swollen and heavy from the constant egg injections and compressions.
Story_83
While her uterus and rectum were repeatedly expanded and contracted.
Yellow
“Is this... really the same demon commander we once couldn’t defeat?”
Story_84
Airisu glanced at Raira with disdain and responded.
LightBlue
“Now, she’s nothing more than an experimental specimen.”
Story_84
The three took one final look at Maris, floating within the tank. 
Story_84
This was the same demon commander who had once plunged the entire city into chaos and destruction.
Story_84
Now, she had been reduced to an experimental tool for humanity’s counteroffensive against the demon realm.
LightBlue
“Let’s go. We still have much work to do.”
Story_84
The trio turned and walked away, their footsteps echoing against the cold metal floor of the laboratory.
Story_84
Maris’s struggles gradually faded.
Story_84
Her consciousness slipping away as her body was completely transformed into the “container” required for the experiments.
Story_84
Her body was thoroughly exploited, becoming nothing more than a perpetual breeding machine.
Story_84
Her dignity had long since been stripped away, leaving her with nothing but endless pain and despair.
Story_84
Day after day, she greeted fresh torment, her existence reduced to something worse than death.
