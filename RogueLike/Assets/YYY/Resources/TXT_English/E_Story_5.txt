The sky stretched out like blood, casting a crimson-black glow across the plaza.
Story_46
This was the "Red Zone," a sinister domain in the demon realm, where countless writhing tentacles covered the ground in a grotesque display.
Story_46
The tentacles seemed alive, twisting together endlessly and occasionally bursting out from the earth, shooting upward like giant predators reaching for the heavens.

The air reeked of a nauseating stench and was thick with dense miasma, devoid of any trace of survivors.

At the center of the plaza, shrouded in the shadows of the tentacles, stood the demon general Malice Tenebral.

Clad in a jet-black gothic dress, her piercing red eyes coldly surveyed the three warriors before her.

Her demonic wings moved slowly behind her, exuding an overwhelming sense of intimidation.

"Welcome to my domain, foolish battle maidens."

Malice spoke with a chilling smile, her cold voice echoing through the air, silencing even the writhing of the tentacles for a moment.

"Now that you have set foot here, you cannot advance unless you defeat me."
Green
"And even if you do, there's no guarantee you will leave here alive."

"We never planned to leave alive!"

"We'll end everything here and now by defeating you!"

Iris maintained a calm demeanor as she held her icy blade, her sharp gaze fixed on Malice.
LightBlue
"We won't retreat in fear. If we're going to fall, it'll be fighting until the very end!"
Green
"Hmph, very well. Let me enjoy your futile resistance to the fullest."
Story_48
Malice spread her wings, making her figure appear even more imposing.
Story_48
In her hand, she held a long crimson sword, the blade swirling with miasma, as if pulsating with a malevolent life force.
Story_48
The sword glowed with an even darker and more sinister light, amplifying her overwhelming presence.
LightRed
"Raira, are you ready?"
Story_49
Ferishia turned back, and Raira, holding a glowing ball of lightning, nodded energetically.
Yellow
"Of course! Let's take this monster down together!"
Story_49
The three warriors exchanged determined glances and leaped into action simultaneously.
